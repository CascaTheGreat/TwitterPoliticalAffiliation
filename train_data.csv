"The late Justice Ginsburg rejected the discredit concept of court-packing. “If anything would make the Court appear partisan, it would be that.” “Nine seems to be a good number.” Justice Breyer just reaffirmed his own opposition. And the American people agree overwhelmingly.", Right
"A major theme of the Biden Administration has been false advertising:  Last month, it was the multi-trillion-dollar “COVID relief” bill that spent only 1% on vaccines.  Now it’s a multi-trillion-dollar “infrastructure” plan where roads and bridges are almost a rounding error.", Right
"The situation at our southern border: record arrivals of unaccompanied minors.   The White House’s response: police the terminology border officials are allowed to use to describe the crisis.   Not securing the border. Just woke proofreading, in a parody of left-wing governance.", Right

"My advice to the Administration: If you want to do an infrastructure bill, let's do an infrastructure bill. Before the pandemic, we had the best economy in 50 years. We should not raise taxes under the guise of an infrastructure bill and send our economy in the wrong direction. ", Right
"The Administration’s non-infrastructure “infrastructure bill” looks like another Trojan horse for far-left demands. Rolling back Right to Work laws. Imposing the biggest new tax hikes in a generation — killing jobs and slowing wage growth when workers need a fast recovery.", Right
"There would be bipartisan support for a serious, targeted infrastructure plan. Unfortunately, less than 6% of this massive White House proposal would go to roads and bridges. It would spend more on electric cars than on roads, bridges, ports, airports, and waterways combined. ", Right
"It’s a modern medical miracle that three safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines were produced in less than one year. Thanks to hardworking Kentuckians at the McKesson facility in Shepherdsville, those vaccines are being distributed all across the country. ", Right
"The border crisis is not just seasonal. CBP is tracking the largest surge in apprehensions in 20 years. Unaccompanied children are piling up in close quarters.   It turns out when politicians spend a two-year campaign advertising a porous border and amnesty, people listen.", Right
"Democrats’ attempted elections takeover has state and local officials sounding alarms. They say its unworkable provisions would invite total chaos in our elections. Even Democratic officials. No wonder Democrats want to talk about everything except what's actually in their bill. ", Right
"Democrats' H.R. 1 would leave elections more vulnerable to cheating, send taxpayer dollars to subsidize campaigns, and would turn the bipartisan Federal Election Commission into a Democrat-controlled partisan body. It’s not about protecting voting. It’s about rigging the system. ", Right
"Tune in now to @FoxNews: I am joining @DanaPerino and @BillHemmer to discuss the crisis at our southern border and the Democrats' plan for a partisan takeover of America’s election systems.", Right
"H.R. 1 is the Democrats’ plan to take over the American election system and have it run by Washington bureaucrats. Democrats want to force all kinds of unpopular changes on all 50 states because they believe it would benefit their side. ", Right
"Senate Democrats just spent the last four years using the legislative filibuster and talking constantly about how important it was. Their reversals aren’t about principle. It’s just raw power. And their excuses insult the intelligence of the American people.", Right
"A key purpose of the Senate was to ensure all parts of the country have a voice.   Leaders from New York and California want to break the Senate’s rules on legislation because they want to steamroll the interests of Kentucky and Middle America.   ", Right
"Secretary Mayorkas testified “the border is secure and the border is not open.” So either @fema has been deployed just to admire a situation going smoothly... or the Biden Administration is not being straight with the American people.", Right
"The science on getting kids back in school is crystal clear. Every day the Biden Administration does not urge schools to reopen safely right now with simple precautions, the most vulnerable kids pay the price.", Right
"The Administration claims their top priority is to beat this virus and end the pandemic. But their nominee to run @HHSGov is woefully unqualified. California AG Xavier Becerra is a partisan politician with no expertise in healthcare.", Right
"If Democrats break the Senate rules and kill the filibuster by a 50-50 vote, they will regret it. The pendulum would swing both ways, and it would swing hard. ", Right
"My definition of a crisis is when you send the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which only goes to emergencies, down to the border.  This is a crisis. The Administration created it, and they own it. ", Right
"Eliminating the legislative filibuster is not in the best interest of the country, no matter which party is in control. Anyone who really understands the Senate knows that steamrolling the rules wouldn't fast-track policymaking. Everything would grind to a halt. ", Right
"Top Democrats’ drive to break Senate rules is shamelessly hypocritical. Just two years ago, they called the filibuster an essential part of the Senate that should never go away.  Apparently their only principle is that they want Democrats to have all the power, all the time. ", Right
"Tune in now to @FoxNews. I am joining @HARRISFAULKNER to discuss Democrats’ border crisis and the importance of preserving Senate rules on legislation.", Right
"Breaking Senate rules to kill the filibuster would not open up an express lane to liberal change. It would not open up an express lane for the Biden presidency to speed into the history books. The Senate would function more like a hundred-car pile-up. Nothing moving.", Right
"I'm glad @SecBlinken and @SecDef are engaging with key Asian allies Japan and South Korea this week. We need to work together to defend against threats from China and North Korea and stand up for democracy in Burma in the face of military dictatorship.", Right
"Why did President Biden tell Americans to wait until July 4th to gather in ways that cities, states, and the CDC approve right now? Why did he present a million vaccines per day as a personal “Mission Accomplished” moment when it’s simply the pace Democrats inherited in January?", Right
"On Thursday, President Biden spoke in a heartfelt way about grief and loss. But his vision for the road ahead missed the mark. His proclamations broke with Dr. Fauci and his own CDC and ignored what Americans are already doing now. It was like a speech for an alternate universe.", Right
"House Democrats' H.R. 1 is a partisan assault on elections. It directly targets political speech and would centralize control of elections in all 50 states in Washington Democrats’ hands.  A dramatic one-party power grab over the way Americans vote. ", Right
"In 2020, Senate Republicans led Congress to pass five historic bipartisan bills.  Because of that, the American people have been marching toward victory. Democrats just want to sprint to the front of that parade and claim the credit. ", Right
"Our country has endured one of the most painful years in memory. But the dark times have spotlighted the best of America.    This year’s recovery will ride an already turning tide. Not because of a Democrats’ latest partisan bill, but because of the resilience of our people. ", Right
"Last Congress, Sen. Schumer and Democrats used the filibuster frequently. And I respected the institution more than any short-term advantage we might have achieved if we’d eliminated it.    Majorities come and go, but the essence of the Senate stays. ", Right
"President Biden's spending bill is a classic example of big Democratic overreach in the name of COVID relief. It manages to spend only ~1% on vaccinations and less than 9% on the entire health fight.  This is by far one of the worst pieces of legislation I've seen in the Senate. ", Right
"The Administration is flailing and failing on our southern border. The number of unaccompanied children has tripled in two weeks.  The White House keeps saying “Now is not the time to come.” So there will be a good time in the future to break federal law and come illegally?", Right
"I’ve voted for several of President Biden’s nominees. But his choices to lead Interior and the EPA appear eager to restart the left’s war on domestic energy. Kentuckians know that when radical policies are on the table, it means their jobs and pocketbooks are on the menu.", Right
"House Democrats’ attempt to forcibly rewrite 50 states’ election laws would weaken voter I.D., mass legalize ballot harvesting, and let a partisan FEC poke around in more of citizens' political speech. No wonder the only thing bipartisan about the bill was the vote against it.", Right
"Senator Blunt has tackled so much important work for Missouri and our country and has been an enormous asset to all his colleagues. I’m very sorry he’ll be stepping away but am glad the country has two more years to keep benefitting from his talent. My full statement: ", Right
"Instead of working together to fight COVID-19, Democrats decided to exploit the crisis by jamming through unrelated liberal policies they couldn’t pass honestly. A colossal missed opportunity for the American people. My full statement: ", Right
"Democrats said they’d exploit COVID to “restructure things to fit our vision.” Sure enough: Only 9% of their bill for the entire health fight. Only 1% for vaccines. All this borrowed money for a parade of unrelated policies that even left-wing experts say are badly targeted.", Right
"We're already set to come roaring back — not due to this liberal spending spree. Democrats inherited a tide that was already turning. We could have worked together to do something smart &amp; bipartisan to finish this fight ASAP. Democrats decided to do something else.", Right
"I am continuing to monitor severe flooding across Kentucky. Yesterday I spoke with leaders in some of the hardest-hit counties. My staff and I are ready to do our part to get federal assistance to these communities. ", Right
"TUNE IN NOW: I'm joining @marthamaccallum to discuss the urgent priorities Senate Republicans are focused on -- reopening schools, helping workers, and getting more Americans vaccinated -- and the liberal wish-list Democrats are pushing instead.", Right
"What the American people need are fast-acting plans to open schools now, get laid-off Americans into jobs, and finish the fight against COVID-19.   The Democrats’ plan doesn’t focus on that. It manages to spend ~$2T while leaving the most urgent things on the cutting room floor. ", Right
"It was my honor to get to thank some of the @kentuckyguard who answered the call to help protect the Capitol. Your Congress and your country appreciate all you’ve done. ", Right
"Less than 9% of Democrats' spending plan would go to directly fight COVID-19. Less than 1% to vaccinations.  This isn’t a recipe to safely reopen America. It’s what Democrats promised almost a year ago: Taking advantage of the crisis to check off unrelated liberal policies.", Right
"Only 1% of the Democrats’ partisan bill goes to vaccines. Less than 9% to the entire health effort. It backs the Big Labor myth that schools can’t reopen safely right now — yet only a small fraction of its K-12 money would go out this year. Liberal ideology, not families' needs.", Right
"More great news this morning as Kentuckians help turn the tide against COVID-19. The newly-approved Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is now shipping out, thanks to workers at McKesson’s distribution facility in Shepherdsville. ", Right
"The House’s partisan vote reflects a deliberately partisan process and a missed opportunity to meet Americans’ needs. My full statement: ", Right
"Washington should focus on practical policies to finish this fight. Accelerate vaccinations. Get kids back in school. Help laid-off Americans get rehired. Instead, Democrats are pushing a partisan bill, packed with non-COVID-related spending &amp; bad ideas that will slow recovery. ", Right
"TUNE IN NOW: I am joining @BretBaier to discuss Republicans’ work to help our nation reopen and recover — and the $1.9T liberal spending plan the Democrats are focused on instead. ", Right
"Only about 1% of the Democrats’ partisan plan goes to vaccines. Only about 5% of its K-12 funding would even go out this fiscal year.  Democrats are not addressing the urgent needs of a re-opening America. They started with a preconceived liberal wish-list and worked backwards.", Right
"This evening I joined congressional leaders on the Capitol steps in a moment of silence for the 500,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus. ", Right
"Science and data disprove the Democrats' notion that K-12 schools need their new spending plan before they can open safely. Under their plan, about 95% of the K-12 money would not even go toward the current year’s budget. Stop letting Big Labor move the goalposts on our kids.", Right
"The facts are clear: In-person schooling is essential for kids and can be safe. France and Spain have been doing it. The U.K. will have kids back in two weeks. A study from our own CDC last month found that schools can operate safely. Why won't Democrats accept the science?", Right
"The partisan bill Democrats are preparing is stuffed with non-COVID-related liberal goals and more band-aid policies as if the country were going to stay shut down another year. We need 2021 to be different than 2020. Congress should focus on smart policies to help that happen.", Right
"Families across Kentucky are still recovering from a week of punishing weather. I am grateful to everyone who pitched in and helped their neighbors stay safe. My team and I are focused and ready to help in the recovery.", Right

"Democrats' so-called relief bill includes Sen. Sanders’s minimum wage proposal that would kill 1.4M American jobs. This after the President killed many thousands of jobs with Keystone XL. Killing jobs and destroying opportunity — that's their idea of pandemic relief?", Right
"Democrats admitted last March: They see the pandemic as an opportunity to ram through ideological change.  That's why they are now pushing a sprawling $1.9T plan that even liberal economists say is poorly targeted to the urgent needs of our nation.", Right
"George Shultz was one of the great Americans of our time. Nobody better exemplified a thoughtful, principled, and patriotic commitment to public service. A scholar-statesman for the ages. My full statement: ", Right
"Pres. Biden's own scientists agree school appears to be quite safe and we should get our kids back. Congress sent massive sums for K-12 schools in 2020. Hardly any of it has been spent yet. Federal funding is not the issue. It's Big Labor moving the goalposts on kids &amp; parents.", Right
"We’ve heard a lot of talk about unity, but White House staff and congressional Democrats are working from the opposite playbook. Senate Republicans will be ready and waiting with a host of amendments to improve the rushed procedural step that’s being jammed through. ", Right
"Science tells us that in-person school can be safe — and is crucial for children’s futures. We cannot keep this essential part of our society on indefinite hiatus. No more goalpost-moving from Big Labor. Kids have sacrificed enough. States and districts need to get this done.", Right
"Science has spoken and the evidence is clear: It is time to get kids back in school.  Experts say that with basic precautions, risks of transmission are low. And the costs of the online-only approach for kids are very high.", Right

"The Senate requires collaboration and deliberation. It’s a feature, not a bug, that slim majorities can't ram through half-baked ideas. My remarks on the legislative filibuster and why I stuck up for the minority’s rights even when Republicans had power: ", Right
"I’m glad that two Senate Democrats confirmed today they will not vote to end the legislative filibuster. They agree with President Biden and me on protecting the Senate.   With this win, we can move forward with a 50-50 power-sharing agreement built on the 2001 precedent. ", Right
"It was my honor to get to meet and thank some of the @KentuckyGuard who answered the call to help protect the Capitol and the inauguration. ", Right
"The failed Paris deal will hurt American families while China and Russia grow emissions. The Keystone cancellation will kill union jobs and hurt U.S. energy security. And a proposal to gut immigration enforcement and give blanket amnesty? Rough "day one" for American workers.", Right
"Minority rights on legislation are key to the Senate. President Biden spent decades defending them. More than two dozen Senate Democrats backed them just four years ago. This isn't complicated. Simply reaffirming that Democrats won't break the rules should not be a heavy lift.", Right
